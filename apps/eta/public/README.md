# PWA Icons Needed

The following icon files are required for the PWA to work properly:

- `favicon.ico` - 32x32 or 16x16 favicon
- `apple-touch-icon.png` - 180x180 Apple touch icon
- `android-chrome-192x192.png` - 192x192 Android icon
- `android-chrome-512x512.png` - 512x512 Android icon

## Theme

All icons should feature an hourglass to match the app's theme (representing time estimation and task progress).

## Color Scheme

- Primary color: Brown (#8B4513)
- Background: White (#ffffff)

## Temporary Solution

Until proper icons are created, the app will work but won't have proper PWA icons when installed.

## How to Create Icons

1. Design an hourglass icon
2. Export at the required sizes
3. Place files in this directory
4. Test PWA installation on mobile devices
